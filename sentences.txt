The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
I am not gonna run away, I never go back on my word! That's my nindo: my ninja way! .
Life is a box of chocolates Forrest. You never know what you're gonna get.
You can't change the past. But you can learn something from it.
It's not about how much we lost; it's about how much we have left.
Fear is not evil, It tells you what weakness is, And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.
Either in belief or doubt, if I lean to one of these sides, my reaction time will be dulled if my heart thinks the opposite of what I choose.
May the Force be with you.
As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again.
