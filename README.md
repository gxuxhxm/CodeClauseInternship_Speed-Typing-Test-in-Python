# Typing Speed Test with Tkinter GUI

## Overview
This Python application serves as a Typing Speed Test Calculator, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The calculator assesses the user's typing speed by randomly selecting sentences from a predefined list. It calculates words per minute (WPM) and provides instant feedback on accuracy. Additionally, the application displays the overall average speed after multiple attempts.

## Technical Details
### Modules Used
- **tkinter:** Primary GUI toolkit for Python.
- **random:** Generates random sentences for typing tests.
- **time:** Measures time intervals during typing to calculate speed.
- **string:** Manages character sets for handling user inputs.
- Dark theme colors are applied for improved aesthetics.

### Implementation
- **Sentence Selection:** Random sentences are selected for the typing test from a predefined list.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The UI dynamically adjusts to user inputs, providing real-time feedback on accuracy and speed.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is implemented to gracefully manage scenarios like exceeding the time limit, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Execution
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed on the machine.
